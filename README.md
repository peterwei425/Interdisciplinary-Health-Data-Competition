# Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition

I partnered with 2 PHD students from Medical School and two classmates from my MSBA program at University of Minnesota to participate the [first interdisciplinary health data competition](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/health-data-competition) in 2020. The goal of the competition was to promote interdisciplinary dialogue around real-world healthcare challenges and for students to provide innovative solutions using data science tools and methodologies. Our team completed an exploratory analysis of newly released prescription drug use and cost data from the Minnesota Department of Healthâ€™s Minnesota All Payer Claims Database.
