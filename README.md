# Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition

## Introduction 
I partnered with 2 PHD students from Medical School and two classmates from my MSBA program at University of Minnesota to participate [the First Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/health-data-competition) in 2020. The goal of the competition was to promote interdisciplinary dialogue around real-world healthcare challenges and for students to provide innovative solutions using data science tools and methodologies. Our team completed an exploratory analysis of newly released prescription drug use and cost data from the Minnesota Department of Health’s Minnesota All Payer Claims Database. 

## Project Overview 

Through exploratory data analysis, our team discovered the disparity between high occurrence of cardiovascular disease and its low insurance coverage based on 2 years’ drug and prescription data. We provided policy recommendations which potentially bring $14.2M net savings for the Minnesota Government. 

## Datasets

The Heath Data Competition dataset is provided by the Minnesota Department of Health's Minnesota All Payer Claims Database, a data system authorized by the legislature for health policy development in Minnesota.  The healthcare claims data is from medical providers' billing records sent to insurance companies, plan administrators and public payers.  It includes health care claims managed by nearly all private and public payers, including inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care settings, a unique distinction among claims databases in the country. 

The newly released public use files represent the single most comprehensive view of health care in Minnesota and offers an unprecedented opportunity for Minnesota to learn more about what types of services are provided across the state, how much they cost, and what outcomes are achieved.
